       <br>
       In Steven Universe, the world is protected from evil threats by the Crystal Gems, a movement of Gems sworn to protect the Earth from the Homeworld Gems. 
       Steven is a young half-human, half-gem boy who inherited his gemstone from his mother, a Crystal Gem named Rose Quartz, who gave up her form to create Steven.

In the show, Steven is the son of Greg Universe, a human musician, and Rose Quartz, the former leader of the Crystal Gems. Rose is described as having "given up her physical form to bring [Steven] into the world" as the first Gem-human hybrid, and her gemstone is embedded in his navel.

            <IMG SRC=”https://i.redd.it/2m82azet1cpx.png" ALIGN=”left” /> The disciplined current leader of the Crystal Gems, Garnet (voiced by Estelle) is quiet, stoic, pragmatic, and described by Steven as "mysterious", but over the course of the series she becomes more emotionally open, especially in expressing her love for Steven. According to the writers, her great self-confidence is reflected in the fact that she never asks questions. She possesses red garnets in the palms of her hands, from which she summons her Gem weapon, a pair of heavy gauntlets. She also has a precognitive ability she refers to as "future vision". Garnet has three eyes, over which she wears a visor.

Her amethyst gemstone, from which she can summon a whip, is located on her chest; she also makes frequent use of shapeshifting capabilities.
